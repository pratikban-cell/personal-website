Live Site: banpratik.com.np
This is my personal portfolio website, designed and developed to showcase my work, projects, and journey as a student exploring technology, data, and problem-solving.

The website serves as a digital space where I highlight the projects I’ve built, my technical skills, and my growing experience in areas like IT, project management, and software development.

I built this site from scratch as a creative way to combine design, development, and storytelling — reflecting who I am as a learner and a builder.
